TODO:

	Try optimizing the code with the RGB_TYPE enum.
	Put the default color resistor set into a separate file.
	Finish turning the resistors into percentages. ✓
	Add the colorDecoder.c and .h files. ✓
		(Well, I am an idiot. Converting bytes to 8-bit RGB isn't encoding; it's decoding. Therefore, the file is now called colorDEcoder, not colorENcoder. I'll learn from this.)
	Convert the percentages into RGB values. ✓
	Do LOTS of cleaning.
